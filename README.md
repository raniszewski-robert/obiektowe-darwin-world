# Darwin World Simulator
This Java code simulates an evolution of animals on 2D map made of grids, where animals will move, eat plants, reproduce and die from starvation or wildfires.
Simulation follows certain rules:
- Each animal has energy and genes which determine its everyday movement behavior. Those are inherited from their parents with certain mutations
- Everyday, plants are grown and every animal who steps on a grid that contains a plant, eats it.
- If two animals meet at one grid and they have enough energy, they reproduce.
- Every configurable amount of days, wilfire starts on random plant with ability to spread.
- If animal hits 0 energy or moves to a grid with wildfire, it dies.
